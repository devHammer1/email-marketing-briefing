## 💡 Technical Highlight: Responsive Tables

The project includes a robust technique for making large data tables manageable on small screens. Instead of shrinking illegibly, the table columns collapse into "blocks" on smaller screens, with the column headers displayed as bold labels next to the data.

This is achieved using the `data-label` attribute on the `<td>` tags, targeted specifically within a CSS media query.
